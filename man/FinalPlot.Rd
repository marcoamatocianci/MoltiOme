\title{Create a Scatter Plot of Paired RNA vs. ATAC Values}
\usage{
FinalPlot(gr_atac_annotated, normalized_rna_data, normalized_atac_data, color)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr_atac_annotated}{A `GRanges` object containing annotated ATAC-seq peaks.
Must include metadata columns `gene_id` (the overlapping gene) and `Peaks_id`.
Non-annotated peaks (where `gene_id` is NA) will be ignored.}

\item{normalized_rna_data}{A data frame or data.table of normalized RNA-seq data.
Must have a `row.names` column containing gene IDs that match `gene_id`
in `gr_atac_annotated`. Columns should correspond to samples.}

\item{normalized_atac_data}{A data frame or data.table of normalized ATAC-seq data.
Must have a `row.names` column containing peak IDs that match `Peaks_id`
in `gr_atac_annotated`. Columns should correspond to samples.}

\item{color}{A variable to map to the color aesthetic in `ggplot2`. This can be a
static value (e.g., `"blue"`) or a column name from the reshaped data
(e.g., `atac.Name` to color points by sample).}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object showing the scatter plot of ATAC vs. RNA values.
}
\description{
This function generates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
normalized ATAC-seq and RNA-seq values for features linked by a common gene.
It integrates annotated peak data with expression data, reshapes it into a
long format, and plots the paired values.
