\title{Annotate Genomic Features with Overlapping Protein-Coding Genes}
\usage{
MapProteinCodingOverlaps(gtf, gr_feature)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtf}{A `GRanges` object containing GTF annotation data. Must includ e metadata columns:
- `type`: Feature type (e.g., "gene")
- `gene_biotype`: Gene classification (e.g., "protein_coding")
- `gene_id`: Unique gene identifiers}

\item{gr_feature}{A `GRanges` object containing genomic features to annotate (e.g., peaks, regions)}
}
\value{
The input `gr_feature` with added `gene_id` metadata column indicating overlapping
  protein-coding genes. Non-overlapping features receive `NA`.
}
\description{
Identifies overlaps between genomic features and protein-coding genes from GTF annotation,
then adds gene IDs to feature metadata.
}
