\usage{
PeakStats(expression, atac)
}
\arguments{
\item{expression}{A data.frame or data.table (or GRanges) with a `Gene_Expression_id` column for gene expression features.}

\item{atac}{A data.frame or data.table (or GRanges) with `gene_id` (overlapping gene) and `Peaks_id` columns for ATAC-seq features.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with one row and the following columns:
  - `tot_peaks`: Total number of ATAC peaks
  - `merged_num`: Number of peaks overlapping genes with expression data
  - `non_merged`: Number of peaks not overlapping any expressed gene
  - `prc_tot`: Percentage of merged peaks out of total
  - `prc_unmerged`: Percentage of non-merged peaks out of total
}
\description{
Computes statistics on the overlap between ATAC-seq peaks and gene expression features.
